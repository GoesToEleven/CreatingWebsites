<!--Relative positioning is more straightforward:
it tells the element to move relative to where it would have landed
if it just had the default static positioning.

If you give an element relative positioning and tell it to have a margin-top of 10px,
it doesn't move down ten pixels from any particular thing — it moves down ten pixels from
where it otherwise would have been.


relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element
will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted
to fit into any gap left by the element. (learnlayout)-->


<!--With relatively positioned elements, it’s important to know that
the box offset properties identify where an element will be moved from
given its original position (howe)-->.

<!--This type of positioning is probably the most confusing and misused.
What it really means is "relative to itself". If you set position: relative; on an element
but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), it will no effect
on it's positioning at all, it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as position: static;
But if you DO give it some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift it's
position 10 pixels DOWN from where it would NORMALLY be.
I'm sure you can imagine, the ability to shift an element around based on it's regular position
is pretty useful. I find myself using this to line up form elements many times that have a
tendency to not want to line up how I want them to. (css-tricks)-->
