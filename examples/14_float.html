<!--the float property allows us to take an element, remove it from the normal flow of a page,
and position it to the left or right of its parent element. All other elements on the page will then
flow around the floated element. An <img> element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text,
for example, will allow the paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary. (howe)-->

<!--When the float property is used on multiple elements at the same time, it provides the ability to
 create a examples by floating elements directly next to or opposite each other,
 as seen in multiple-column layouts. (howe)-->
