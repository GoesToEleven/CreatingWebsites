FLEX GROW
expressed using a number
used to determine how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items inside the container.
If every flex item has a flex grow of one for example, each item would be the same size.
If flex grow is not defined for an item, it defaults to one.

FLEX SHRINK
expressed using a number
determines how much a flex item will shrink relative to other flex items inside the container.
it defaults to one if you leave it off.

FLEX BASIS
expressed using the same values you would use for an element's width:
                pixels, percentages, any length, the key word auto
This value is then used as the initial, main size, of an element
    before any remaining free space has been distributed.
If you leave it off, the initial value is assumed to be zero.

FLEX
shorthand notation for
flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis
flex-shrink and flex-basis are optional

IN PRACTICE
In most cases, you won't be setting all three values.
Usually, I see either
        a single flex grow value
        or a combination of flex grow and flex basis
If you want a list of common values and how they affect an item's flexibility,
check out the section on the flex property in the W3C flexbox specification.
